        <textarea id="entry">This sentence has five words. Here are five more words. Five=word sentneces are fine. But several together become montonous. Listen to what is happening. The writing is getting boring. The sound of it drones. It's like a stuck record. The ear demands some variety.
		Now listen. I vary the sentence length, and I create music. Music. The writing sings. It has a pleasant rhythm, a lilt, a harmony. I use short sentences. And I use sentneces of medium length. And sometimes when I am certain the reader is rested, I will engage him with a sentence of considerable length, a sentence that burns with energy and builds with all impetus of a crescendo, the roll of the drums, the crash of the cymbals-sunds that say listen to this, it is important.
		So write with a combination of short, medium, and long sentences. Create a sound that pelases the reader's ear. Don't just write words. Write music
