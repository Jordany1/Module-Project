Overview:
This code takes what you type in the text area and outputs the sentences that are highlighted by different colours based on how many words are in the sentence.

Planning:
- Make the text area in HTML
- Create a function that that changes the colour of the sentence based on the length of the sentences in JavaScript
- Put the colours that the sentences will be in CSS
- Add a background to make it look nice

Review:
The script works and it does everything I wanted it to do, the web page also looks nice because of the background I added after I finished all the important things.
